ans: The main() in java is the starting point of the program from where JVM start it's 
     execution without the main() JVM cannot execute the program.
     Syntax of java:
                       public static void main(string[] args);
    Here,
    - "public" is the access specifier. It helps JVM to identify the execution point of program.
    - "static" is the keyword. Whenever, the main() is call by using static keyword we don't need
      to create object.
    - "void" is the return type statement. It specify that the program cannot not return any value.
    - "main" is a default signature which is predefined in java. It specify to execute the program
      line by line and stop execution after completion of this method.
    - "string[] args" state that whenever the program take some data from the user, the data is 
      execute in string format.It accept group of string called as string array. args[] is the 
      array name and it is of string type. It also take input in numbers form.
